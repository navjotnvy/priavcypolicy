I am using firebase and admob in my project but i am not collecting any user data. 
The connection is there for future implementation.
I will change my privacy policy if i update my app with user information being used by my app.

The camera permission used is to make sure that the user can scan the QR code when the alarm goes off. 
We are not accessing any user data through camera permission in the app.
